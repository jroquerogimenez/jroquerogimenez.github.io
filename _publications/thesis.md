Variable selection is increasingly becoming a key step in any data analysis pipeline. Identifying
true relationships between a large number of covariates and a response of interest is a challenging
problem that often requires strong modeling assumptions. In this thesis we develop new variable
selection methodologies in two different directions. Our contributions build on the recently developed
knockoff procedure as well as the causal invariance framework. We show how to aggregate data
originating from heterogeneous datasets generated through different experimental settings to estimate
causal effects and identify the relevant covariates in a causal sense. Our methodology efficiently
uses all available information, and we propose an extension to high dimensions where the number of
samples available per environment is small. Finally, we develop a Causal Boosting algorithm that
efficiently recovers non-linear causal response functions from multiple datasets where different subsets
of covariates are randomized. On a different topic, we propose some improvements on the knockoff
procedure by extending the scope of datasets where such methodology can be applied. Going beyond
Gaussian distributions, we propose a Bayesian Network knockoff sampling procedure that fits a much
larger class of distributions. Also, we identify sources of instability in the procedure and devise an
entropy based multi-knockoff procedure to mitigate the variability of the selected set of variables
induced by the randomized nature of the procedure.
